## Fly link


## Enjoyed:
Making a tangible website - that addresses an issue we face often.

Collaboration on github experience. Made me excited for the real world, and learning to do it more correctly.

## Disliked:
Fly.io not being a tool that can function on the school's network was a challenge with coordinting group work and turning the assignment in.
Final set to deploy on campus 4/27 not working likely resulting in high penalty. Planning and being agead of time could address from a personal responsibility standpoint. Technology vetting sould also have been set up for higher likleyhood of success.

Limitations of ideas based on available API's

Git collab still is unclear. We likely overcommitted and faced challenges.

## Technical Requireemnts
