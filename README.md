## Fly link


## Enjoyed:
Making a tangible website - that addresses an issue we face often.

Collaboration on github experience. Made me excited for the real world, and learning to do it more correctly.

## Disliked:
Fly.io not being a tool that can function on the school's network was a challenge with coordinting group work and turning the assignment in.
Inability to work on campus presents challenges for all students, with varied network access.

Limitations of ideas based on available API's

Git collab still is unclear. We likely overcommitted and faced challenges.

## Technical Requireemnts
